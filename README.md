 # Who choose or using Darena?

People who want a personal messenger without government or corporate oversight.
Darena dosen't have any public or official server itself. you can run it on your VPS or server even your PC can be a server (hard way for me) :) i dont like it.
Pepole who using Darena, can add their friends or family.


# DarkNet and Darena?

```
  Maybe
```

# Personal Protocol
```
  of course. im useing Leave (Enigma) myself for Darena. if you want to run your protocol its will be so simple.
  remember to change Enigma Settings every special times. using ``` Rotor_Generator.py ```
  
 ```
 
# How to run in on my server? 
```
i put a server file in this repo, run it on your VPS with vps IP and bind it.
change the client connection ip in ui_main.py
```

# This files are beta

``` 
i dont have more energy to code every day on one thing.. personal reasons...
but i work on it for ever 

IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, CODE IT YOUSELF FOR YOURSELF!
